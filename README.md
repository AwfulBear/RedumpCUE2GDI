# What's this?

This a small C# Program to convert Dreamcast Redump Images (bin/cue) and converts them to GDI Images (bin/raw/gdi).

# How to use it?
- Either download a release here from Github and run the exe file.
- Or: Clone this repository, open it in Visual Stdio 2017 and just hit run - no dependencies except System.Windows.Forms and mscorlib

Once the program starts, just take a cue File and drag & drop it onto the window. Kinda like oggdropXPd or lamedropXPd.
To exit the program, just right click the window.

# Legal stuff
This software contains CueSharp licensed under the 2-clause BSD License found here: [here](https://wyday.com/bsd-license.php)

The character animation playing while the program is busy is taken from easyRPG's RTP Replacement found [here](https://github.com/EasyRPG/RTP) 
This software itself it license under 2-clause BSD as well. I'm not good with legal stuff, but I believe these licenses should be compatible. If you can help me with this stuff, please message me.
